there is just inside the body there is 1 h1 element and then there is a div container after it 
the div container has a class of accordian 
under the div container there are many identical div containers with the same class called accordian-item 
so inside the individual accordian-item container we have two things 
these are basically just 2 div elements . one for the title of and other for the brief content of that title 
and this functionality is the only thing about this project 
header div has the class of accordian-item-header
and content div has the class of accordian-item-body
inside the css file we kinda imported the google fonts we wanted to import 
there is a universal selector.. all the margins of the elements inside this document is set to zero and border-box means the content will reduce in size if there is not space..
the body element is using the montserrat font sans as backup 
backgroundcolor and color of the body element is set to opposite ..
font size is actually customised to 2.5*16 px
i kinda changed the widht and margin properties to actually make the h1 element smaller and in the center 
to center the h1 element we made it about 50% of the container which is the body element and specifying the top and bottom margin and setting the left and right to auto for the browser to figure it out
